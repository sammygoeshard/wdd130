        <img src="images/samuel-profile.jpg" alt="Hello! I am Samuel Jaspe" width="200">
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Samuel, and I'm genuinely excited to be embarking on this learning journey with all of you.  
            Though I may be one of the younger members of the class, being seventeen, I believe a fresh perspective and boundless enthusiasm 
            can be just as valuable. My background is rooted in Venezuela, a country whose vibrant culture and passionate spirit have 
            certainly shaped the person I am today. I carry that warmth and energy with me, and I look forward to connecting with each 
            of you from various backgrounds and places. Outside of my current studies, a major part of my life is dedicated to art. 
            Whether it's the classical masters, contemporary installations, or simply the beauty found in everyday design, I find 
            immense inspiration and solace in creative expression. Art, to me, is not just about aesthetics; it's about problem-solving, 
            attention to detail, and conveying complex ideas through elegant forms—skills I'm quickly realizing are highly relevant in 
            the world of programming and development. This appreciation for structure and beauty naturally guides my approach to coding.  
            I am currenntly diving headfirst into the fascinating world of Python and foundational web development. This new venture feels 
            like a perfect blend of logic and creativity. 
            I love the challenge of taking a complex idea and breaking it down into a series of logical steps, watching it come to life line by line. 
            There’s a certain magic in writing code that translates into a functional, useful tool, and I am driven by the desire to master the 
            fundamentals and start building things that matter. I'm at the stage where every new concept, be it a Python library or a CSS property, 
            feels like unlocking a new superpower. </p>

            <h2>Venezuela</h2>
            <img src="images/venezuelan-landscape.jpg" alt="Salto Angel, Angel Falls">
            <p>Venezuela is a country located on the northern coast of South America, known for its stunning natural
                beauty which
                includes the Andes Mountains, Amazon rainforest, Caribbean coastline, and vast plains called the llanos.
                It's home to
                Angel Falls, the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall. Historically, Venezuela's economy has been
                heavily reliant on
                its enormous oil reserves, which are among the largest globally. The capital and largest city is
                Caracas. The nation has
                a rich cultural heritage but has faced significant political and economic challenges in recent years,
                leading to a
                complex humanitarian situation and large-scale emigration.
