            <p>Venezuela is a country located on the northern coast of South America, known for its stunning natural
                beauty which
                includes the Andes Mountains, Amazon rainforest, Caribbean coastline, and vast plains called the llanos.
                It's home to
                Angel Falls, the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall. Historically, Venezuela's economy has been
                heavily reliant on
                its enormous oil reserves, which are among the largest globally. The capital and largest city is
                Caracas. The nation has
                a rich cultural heritage but has faced significant political and economic challenges in recent years,
                leading to a
                complex humanitarian situation and large-scale emigration.
