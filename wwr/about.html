        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Since our inception in 1995, White Water Rafting Company (WWR) has been 
            at the forefront of adventure tourism. Founded by a group of passionate 
            outdoor enthusiasts, WWR started with a single raft and a vision to share 
            the thrill of white water rafting with others. Over the years, we have 
            expanded our fleet, trained numerous guides, and established partnerships 
            with local communities to promote sustainable tourism. Our commitment to 
            safety and environmental conservation has earned us a reputation as a 
            trusted leader in the industry. Today, WWR continues to evolve, offering 
            new and exciting rafting experiences while staying true to our roots and 
            values.
